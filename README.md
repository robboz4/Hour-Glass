Cube LED Hour Glass Project.

Code is for an Arduino with a LED matrix and backpack ( Adafruit) and a 180 degree servo. The program will display an animated hour glass (sand or pixels falling down) taking approximately 4 hours. After four hours the servo will take one hour to rotate and the animation begins again for 4 hours. It then repeats until powered off.

At this time the code is still in development for timing and the physical set up of the servo horn and LED matrix.

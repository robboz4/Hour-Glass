Cube LED Hour Glass Project.

Code is for an Arduino with a LED matrix and backpack ( Adafruit) and a 180 degree servo.
 The program will display an animated hour glass (sand or pixels falling down) taking 
 approximately 4 hours. After four hours the servo will take one hour to rotate and the
 animation begins again for 4 hours. It then repeats until powered off.

 This code includes libraries from Adafruit for the LED back pack I used. Adding required notifictaion:

 ***
 This is a library for our I2C LED Backpacks
  
  Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit LED Matrix backpacks

  These displays use I2C to communicate, 2 pins are required to 
  interface. There are multiple selectable I2C addresses. For backpacks
  with 2 Address Select pins: 0x70, 0x71, 0x72 or 0x73. For backpacks
  with 3 Address Select pins: 0x70 thru 0x77
